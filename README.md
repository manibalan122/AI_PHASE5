### Installation

Provide step-by-step instructions for installing the project and any dependencies.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/company-registration-trends.git
cd company-registration-trends

# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the project
python main.py
```

## Usage

Explain how users can interact with and utilize your project for AI-driven exploration and prediction of company registration trends. Include code examples, usage scenarios, and sample input/output data. Detail the steps users should follow to analyze and predict trends.

```python

import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('company_registration_data.csv')

# Split the data
X = data.drop('registration_status', axis=1)
y = data['registration_status']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Train and evaluate a model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy}")
```
